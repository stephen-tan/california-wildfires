# California Wildfires Analysis
## Team & Project Overview
As the final project for Data Analytics boot camp, our team was made up of these members: Cassie Xu, Jinfang Li, Stephen Tan, Rachel Tsuchiyama and Wendy Mudzinski.  The subject we chose was the California Wildfires Analysis.  As the summer comes to a close, it's important to analyze the past fire data and current precipitation values to get a gauge on what we may experience in the next upcoming fire season.  Some of the variables that can cause fires include weather patterns, fuel/environmental factors, drought/water levels, the number of fire stations/resources available at the time of an incident, and preventative measures.

## High-Level Overview
Our goal is to first determine the xxx by looking at the largest fires in the past xxx years.  From this data we can see that there are some areas that are more susceptible to fire danger.  In these areas, it's important to share fire awareness.  Also it helps to clear out dead leaves and brush and making sure campfires are put out properly are simple ideas of prevention.  Unfortunately there are always some unexpected incidents that may arise, for example, the lighting of fireworks and random lightning strikes.  However, in looking at the data, we can utilize a model to help predict if/when our next fires may occur.  This way firefighters can take a more proactive approach in combating issues that may occur.

## xxx what we're trying to accomplish
As depicted in Figure1 below, you can see that xxxx

From the model in Figure2, we've applied xxx algorithm to train the data.  From that you can see that the accuracy score is xxx% with the precision at xxx% and the recall at xx%.

## Conclusion
In summary, by looking at the analyzed data, we can assess that 2022 may be another challenging year for fires in California.  When applying the xxx algorithm, the model shows that xxx.  With the xxx algorithm, it looks as though xxx may predict xxx.
