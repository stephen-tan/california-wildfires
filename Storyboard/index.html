                    Our goal is to first determine the most susceptible wildfire areas by looking at the largest fires in recent years. From these data, we can see that there are some areas that are more susceptible to fire danger. In these areas, it's important to share
                    fire awareness. Everyone needs to understand that it's a communal effort that makes a difference. It's really important to clear out dead leaves and brush, for example. Another idea is to make sure campfires are put out properly. These
                    are simple yet necessary ideas on prevention. Unfortunately, there are always some unexpected incidents that may arise, for example, the lighting fireworks and random lightning strikes. However, in looking at the data, we can utilize
                    a model to help predict if/when our next fires may occur. This way firefighters can take a more proactive approach in combating issues that may occur.
